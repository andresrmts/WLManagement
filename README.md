# WLManagement
Weightlifting Competition Management Platform

Hello!

This is my first attempt at building a full stack application from scratch on my own. 

For my first project I have chosen to write a Olympic Weightlifting Management web app that could easily be used in local WL competitions instead of clunky excel worksheets. The application aims to congregate all tasks into one simple web app: host management, athlete management by the coaches, judging and standings.

This is obviously a work in progress so I won't be releasing this to the public anytime soon. I hope to test it out on small scale competitions within my gym, when the app has reached a point where it has at least the bare functionality.


# Installing the app

Installing the app is easy:

> - Clone the repo to your computer
> - npm install
> - npm start

And you should be in the app.
